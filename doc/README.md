The gateway available in this repository need an extra work on your integration side:

 - You have install it using composer
 - You have to inform payum of it own existance
 - You have to integrate your workflow with it

under the subdirectory [sylius-example](./sylius-example), you'll find how I did integrate the project under my sylius project.

beware: it is a higly customized sylius 1.2! which rely on symfony!
You'l need extra work to make it work under your own configuration!
