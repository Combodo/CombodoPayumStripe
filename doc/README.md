## Abstract


The gateway available in this repository is meant to provide you an integration with stripe [Checkout Server](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/server).




# Installation

## Composer

```bash
composer require combodo/stripe-v3
```

Note: for now I do not plan to follow BC rules, use semantic versioning or other, so please check if the code is working after each upgrade.

## plug this gateway

Of course, how you code those step depends of the framework you use.
We've covered those:

### Sylius

### Symfony

Symfony users, you can head to [Symfony dedicated documentation](symfony-examples/raw-example/).

You have no chance, there is no doc yet! but you may take inspiration on the existing one and help us documenting!
