## Developed by Combodo

Combodo is the editor of [iTop](https://www.itophub.io/page/about-itop) the [open source](https://github.com/Combodo/itop) ITSM solution.

For the needs of iTop Hub which offer free and [commercial iTop extensions](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/premium), a stripe integration compatible with the SCA was required.

With no doubt, we opened sourced our development. Please keep in mind that we are not the editor of Payum, thus this integration is probably far from perfect.    

This code 
 - has [community contribution](https://github.com/Combodo/CombodoPayumStripe/graphs/contributors): many thanks folks! 
 - is inspired by 
   - the original stripe gateway 
   - and also by this [proof of concept](https://github.com/Payum/Payum/issues/804#issuecomment-509135558)
