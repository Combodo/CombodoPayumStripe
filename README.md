# Payum gateway : Combodo/StripeV3

This is an **unofficial** & :construction: early WIP :construction: Payum gateway providing an SCA compatible stripe integration.
 


## Developed by Combodo

Combodo is the editor of [iTop](https://www.itophub.io/page/about-itop) the [open source](https://github.com/Combodo/itop) ITSM solution.

For the needs of iTop Hub which offer free and [commercial iTop extensions](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/premium), a stripe integration compatible with the SCA was required.

With no doubt, we opened sourced our development. Please keep in mind that we are not the editor of Payum, thus this integration is probably far from perfect.    



This code is inspired by the original stripe gateway but also by [@PyRowMan](https://github.com/PyRowMan)'s [proof of concept](https://github.com/Payum/Payum/issues/804#issuecomment-509135558)


## Support

Combodo is affiliated with neither Payum and Stripe. You should contact them if you have a problem regarding your integration. 

Nevertheless if you'd like **iTop support** we'd love to help you, do not hesitate to [contact us](https://www.combodo.com/support-304)!
